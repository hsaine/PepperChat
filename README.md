<h1 align="center">PepperChat: Integrating ChatGPT for Intelligent Conversations with Pepper Robot.</h1>


<h1 align="center">Abstract</h1>
This project aims to integrate a GPT-3-based Chatbot into a Pepper robot, harnessing the capabilities of large language models and the diverse functionalities of the robot. The Chatbot will be equipped with the Watson Speech API by IBM, enabling seamless speech-to-text conversion. The primary goal of this project is to facilitate realistic and engaging conversations between users and the robot, while also enhancing the naturalness of various tasks. By leveraging advanced language processingand robotics, this project aims to deliver a memorable and immersive experience with the robot, bridging the gap between humans and intelligent machines.


<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>
In the domains of artificial intelligence, robotics, and computer vision, humanoid robots are frequently utilized for research and development purposes. To investigate human actions such as movement and interaction with surroundings, researchers employ these robots. Through comprehending human behavior, researchers can create more efficient robots capable of carrying out intricate tasks. Humanoid robots find extensive usage in several areas, including research, industry, healthcare, and other fields. With technological progress, we can expect to  witness even more inventive applications of these robots in the
future. Softbank Robotics created Pepper, a humanoid robot that gained widespread recognition and popularity after its debut in 2014, Pepper utilizes advanced sensors and cameras to recognize faces and identify emotions, enabling it to interact with humans naturally and intuitively. Pepper finds frequent application in commercial environments, such as retail stores and customer service centers, where it can assist customers and interact with them. NLP is a distinct area within the field of artificial intelligence that focuses on exploring methods for facilitating communication between people and machines. Its primary goal is to enable robots to comprehend and generate human language, making it a crucial technique in thisregard.

In October 1995, LawrenceR.Rabiner et al. explored fundamental problems in natural language understanding and current approaches in NLP. It highlights key areas for future research and addresses the challenge of portability in NLP systems. In May 2020, Stefanie Tellex et al .created a central aspects
of language use by robots, including understanding natural language requests, using language to drive learning about the physical world, and engaging in collaborative dialogue with a human partner. In 2021, Demetris Vrontis. discussed that in the field of HRI, researchers have examined various aspects
of robot behavior, social cues, and user experience to improve human-robot interactions. These works offer insights into designing effective dialogue systems for robots like Pepper, considering factors such as engagement, trust, and perceived intelligence. In 2023 Abdelrahman Osman Elfak introduced a cloud-based framework to enhance the capabilities of social robots by leveraging cloud computing and clustering. The goal is to overcome the limitations of embedded platforms and enable social robots to access advanced AI-based platforms available online. The proposed framework was tested on different robots, including a customized robot named ”BuSaif” and commercialized robots like ”Husky,” ”NAO,” and ”Pepper”. In March 2023, Erik Billing et al. discussed the transformative effects of large-scale language models on dialogue systems and chatbots, proposing their integration with Pepper robots. Billing et al. created a dialogue system that allows for open conversation with Pepper and Nao robots on a wide variety of subjects, using techniques such as NaoQi software, Google Cloud, and the OpenAI API to GPT-3.

In this project, we successfully integrated ChatGPT, an advanced language model developed by OpenAI, into the Pepper robot, an interactive humanoid robot. This integration aimed to enhance the robot’s conversational capabilities and enable it to provide more natural and engaging interactions with users. By leveraging the power of ChatGPT, the Pepper robot was able to understand and generate human-like responses to user queries. The advanced natural language processing capabilities of ChatGPT allowed the robot to comprehend the context and nuances of the user’sinput, leading to more accurate and meaningful responses.
The integration process involved configuring the OpenAI API and establishing a communication interface between the Pepper robot and the ChatGPT model. By leveraging the Pepper robot’s existing functionalities, such as speech synthesis and gesture control, we created a seamless user experience where the robot could respond to user queries through speech and non-verbal cues. The successful integration of ChatGPT into the Pepper robot showcased the potential of combining advanced language models and robotics technologies. The robot’s ability to engage in dynamic and context-aware conversations opens up numerous possibilities for real-world applications, including personalized assistance, educational interactions, and entertainment experiences. This project represents a significant step forward in the field of human-robot interaction, as it demonstrates the capabilities of integrating state-of-the-art language models into robots to enable more sophisticated and natural conversations. The Pepper robot, enhanced with ChatGPT, has the potential to provide personalized and intelligent interactions, making it a valuable asset in various domains such as customer service, education, and healthcare.
